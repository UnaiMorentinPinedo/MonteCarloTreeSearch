# MonteCarloTreeSearch
Implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. This implemented AI is able to find the best next move among a vector that contains all the possible moves in a game such as (Chess, Go, Amazons ...). 

##
In the repo there can be found the implementation files PlayerAI.cpp and PlayerAI.h. It can also be found MCTS_Paper.pdf file, where all the MCTS algorithm is explained in detail.
